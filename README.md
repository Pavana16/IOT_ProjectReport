# **IOT Project Report**

### **NOTE: Please change stuff according to your topic, DO NOT COPY AS IS.**
***

#### **How much time will it take?**  

Around 7-8hrs, probably a 1.5 day task.

#### **What needs to be done?**

* A PDF report as per the ```Template.pdf``` provided in this repository.

* All the 10 steps as is in the template need to be present in your report as well.

* No code or implementation is expected.

* Explaination of each of the steps along with another example case study is provided in ```Template_Book.pdf```

#### **How can this repository help me?**

* This repository will have my report as a sample (Topic: Self driving RC Car), I'll upload it as I progress.

* All the diagrams' editables versions are present in ```editable_diagrams``` folder. I used [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) to create the charts, which you can just use and edit to fit your project.

* Refer the ```Template_Book.pdf``` for any explaination of what the step is doing.



#### **Tools needed**

* A UML drawing tool, either [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) or StarUML, or any of your choice.

* A circuit designing tool. I used [circuito.io](https://www.circuito.io/).

* A presentation maker.

#### **Points to note**

* Step 5 is a combination of step 2 and 4

* Step 6 is the IOT level diagram that your project belongs to (Refer the pdf in ```editable_diagrams```)

* Step 9: Just download the circuit diagram from somewhere.
